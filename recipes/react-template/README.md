# React Template

This is a reimplementation of the `create-react-app` base template and comes bootstrapped with a `velociraptor` script.

If you are using `velociraptor` you can run the project simply by running `vr build`. Otherwise run it with `denopack -c denopack.config.ts && cp public/favicon.ico dist/favicon.ico`.

File watching and incremental building are still very beta, your mileage may vary.
